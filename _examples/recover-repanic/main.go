// This is an example program that demonstrates an advanced use of the Sentry
// SDK using Hub, Scope and EventProcessor to recover from runtime panics,
// report to Sentry filtering specific frames from the stack trace and then
// letting the program crash as usual.
//
// Try it by running:
//
//  go run main.go
//
// To actually report events to Sentry, set the DSN either by editing the
// appropriate line below or setting the environment variable SENTRY_DSN to
// match the DSN of your Sentry project.
